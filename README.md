Lexical Analyzer and Syntax Analyzer Tools
=========================
Implementation of the first two phases of Analysis Part (Front end) of the compiler using C++.

Phase 1 (Lexical Analyzer):
- This phase of the project aims to build automatic lexical analyzer generator tools.
- This tool has two input files, one for lexical rules and the other for user input.
- The output of this tool is a list of tokens which matches the user's input file.

Phase 2 (Syntax Analyzer â€“ Parser-):
- This phase of the project aims to build automatic parser generator tools.
- This tool has two inputs, one is the context free grammar as input file, and the other is the output of phase one -stream of tokens- 
-The output of this tool is the leftmost derivation for deriving the input tokens.

*Panic mode recovery was used for error handling in the two phases.
